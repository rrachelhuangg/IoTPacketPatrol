                        The data used for this project is a 733,705 element dataset curated by Dyuti_Dasmahaptra on Kaggle and can be found
                        <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dyutidasmahaptra/iot-botnet-traffic-dataset" class="in-text-links">here</a>. The dataset 
                        contains network traffic collected from Internet of Things 
                        (IoT) devices that were operating in environments affected by botnet attacks. Each row in the dataset represents
                        a single network flow with packet sequence ID, used protocol, source and destination IP addresses, source and 
                        destination ports, and a variety of other defining network characteristics. Each network is given a label to 
                        identify if it is an attack and is also subcategorized into its corresponding attack types, if applicable.

                        Univariate plots were created for select features from the dataset. Due to the size of the dataset,
                        these plots were created with only 250,000 (~35%) of the dataset, but display patterns applicable to the entire dataset.
                        There was a significantly greater number of malicious 
                        networks in the training and testing datasets as compared to benign, so the imbalanced dataset was addressed
                        by setting scikit-learn's class weight parameter was to balanced during model training. This class weight parameter 
                        automatically adjusted weights inversely proportional to class frequencies. Deviations from typical mean packet
                        inter-arrival time helped distinguish network traffic, and large numbers of inbound connections usually indicated a scanning or DDoS network attack.

                        80% of the dataset was randomly split and used for training, while the remaining 20% of the dataset was used for testing the 
                        model. To prepare the training portion of the dataset, the network flow data was parsed so that categorical 
                        independent variables were one-hot encoded and ip variables were cast to ipaddress types.

                        The data was then used to train a scikit-learn MultiOutputClassifier model, which applied a logistic regression model
                        to the multi-label classification problem of identifying the categories and subcategories of a malicious network. 
                        The MultiOutputClassifier trained three logistic regression models as independent classifiers for the three output labels:
                        attack identification, attack category, and attack subcategory.

                        The datasets and trained models were stored in MongoDB's Atlas Database. A FastAPI layer was then built on top of the 
                        database with a handful of endpoints that allow the user to query the database. 
                        The live demo page is linked to an endpoint that allows the user to use the trained
                        model to make predictions on inference data. The other endpoints can be found at

                        integrated with a client-side UI that is deployed with Render, a cloud PaaS for
                        deploying web apps.
